# Thesis template
Latex template for DPhil thesis at the University of Oxford.

Each chapter has its own file which can be compiled independently or jointly using the subfiles package. I store images/figures related to each chapter in associated subfolders of the images folder.

Help yourself! No attribution required, make any changes you want, good luck!
